         <b> HOD's MESSAGE</b><br>
  <br>“What a computer is to me is the most remarkable tool that we have ever come up with. It’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.”

  <br>Steve Jobs in 1990

<br>We are in an era of information technology where data and technologies that manipulate the data rule our lives. Computers have gained an importance that other technologies and inventions had to wait for a much longer time. 

<br>Still, computers and related technology show no sign of abating their pace of development.

<br>Being one of the leading technical universities in India, Anna University has always led the change with constant revision of goals and realistic plans to acheive them.
<br>This department that has produced some of the best startups and brightest Engineers in the world. 
<br>Being the hod of this department, I take pride in promoting Computers as a means to achieve a tight integration between humanity and technology. 
<br>Computers are only as smart as the people who program them. 
<br>We, here at College of Engineering, Guindy, take immense efforts to ensure the quality of the engineers by adopting a strategy that goes beyond text books.
<br>Students are given the opportunity for sharpening their real world skills by facilitating Internships, Inplant trainings and Workshops in emerging technologies. 
<br>In keeping with the spirit of staying abreast of latest technology, the department has introduced two new courses related to Big Data Analytics this year. We will keep striving to acheive the best results possible and above all, keep the element of fun and spirit of experimenting in computer science education. 
<br>My sincere wishes to the students for a great academic year ahead.

<br>Anna University, Chennai is one of the leading technical Universities in India located at Tamil Nadu. Department of Computer Science and Engineering (DCSE), formerly known as School of Computer Science and Engineering, was carved out of the School of Electronics and Communication Engineering in September 1987. DCSE functions as one of the University Departments having academic autonomy enabling it to frame its own syllabus and curriculum. It offers undergraduate, postgraduate and research programmes in various disciplines of Computer Science & Engineering.

<br>The Department functions under the Faculty of Information and Communication Engineering.

<br>The Department imparts world class training and platform for research to the students. 
<br>The Department provides state of the art computing facilities to the students enabling them to stay a step ahead. 
<br>It also promotes active industry-institute collaboration by identifying key areas of interest to the industry and taking part in sponsored research projects and consultancy services.

<br>Some of the major research areas on which the faculty members and students working include Networks, Database, Theoretical Computer Science, Multimedia, Image Processing, Software Engineering and Data Mining.

<br>The Department also plays host to a number of workshops and student managed Symposiums. 
<br>Abacus is the official symposium of the Department that sees participants from all over India.
